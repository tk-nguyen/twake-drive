# OnlyOffice connector plugin for Twake Drive

This server sits between the backend server of Twake Drive, and the document editing service of OnlyOffice.

Documentation of the [API used with OnlyOffice is here](https://api.onlyoffice.com/editors/howitworks).

## Running principle

- The connector is added as a plugin application to Twake Drive's configuration
- When a user
  - Creates a file from the templates
    - The file is downloaded by the browser, proxied through the frontend and then backend, to the connector's static assets.
    - The file is then created in Twake Drive by the browser, as any normal file would be
  - Edits or Previews a file that matches the extensions in the configuration of Twake Drive's backend
    - Twake Drive creates a JWT for the current user, then opens in an IFrame either the edit or preview URLs from the configuration.
    - These should point to something ultimately proxied to the view's routes in this connector's `IndexController`
      - The view instantiates [the JS client DocsAPI](https://api.onlyoffice.com/editors/advanced), providing it with URLs to read and write the document. This JS is served directly from the OnlyOffice server which must be accessible to client browsers.
        - The inline configuration provides a read and a write URL to the DocsAPI editor, these point to the routes of `OnlyOfficeController`.
      - When all the clients have disconnected from the editing session on the OnlyOffice document editing service, the OnlyOffice server will call the `callbackUrl` of this connector.
        - The connector then downloads the new file from Only Office, and creates a new version in Twake Drive.

## Configuration example

Let's assume the servers can be contacted at (all but the backend are called directly by the user browser at the same URL as internal calls are made):

- Twake Drive backend: http://backend:4000
- This connector: http://plugins_onlyoffice:5000
- OnlyOffice: http://onlyoffice:8090

### Environment variables for running the connector

- `SERVER_PORT=5000`
- `SERVER_PREFIX=/plugins/onlyoffice/`
- `CREDENTIALS_ENDPOINT=http://backend/`
- `ONLY_OFFICE_SERVER=https://onlyoffice/`
- `CREDENTIALS_ID=tdrive_onlyoffice`
- `CREDENTIALS_SECRET=apisecret`
